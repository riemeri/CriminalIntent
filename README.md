# CriminalIntent
An app which allows users to enter and track "crimes" commited around the office. Users can add a crime, set a date, add a photo, select a suspect, and even quicky send/share a brief overview of the crime. The crime can also be marked as solved, which indicates the crime as solved under the list of crimes. 

### Note
This app was developed for my CS 493 class and the idea comes from the Big Nerd Ranch Android programming book.
